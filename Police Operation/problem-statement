Roy is helping the police department of his city in crime fighting. Today, they informed him about a new planned operation.

Think of the city as a  plane. The road along the -axis is very crime prone, because  criminals live there. No two criminals live at the same position.

To catch these criminals, the police department has to recruit some police officers and give each of them USD  as wages. A police officer can start his operation from any point , drive his car to point  in a straight line, and catch all the criminals who live on this way. The cost of fuel used by the officer's car is equal to the square of the euclidean distance between points  and  (Euclidean distance between points  and  equals to  ).

The police department asks Roy to plan this operation. So Roy has to tell them the number of officers to recruit and the routes these officers should take in order to catch all the criminals. Roy has to provide this information while minimizing the total expenses of this operation.

Find out the minimum amount of money required to complete the operation.
