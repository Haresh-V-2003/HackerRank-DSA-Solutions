Alex has a board game consisting of:

A chip for marking his current location on the board.
 fields numbered from  to . Each position  has a value, , denoting the next position for the chip to jump to from that field.
A die with  faces numbered from  to . Each face  has a probability, , of being rolled.
Alex then performs the following actions:

Begins the game by placing the chip at a position in a field randomly and with equiprobability.
Takes  turns; during each turn he:
Rolls the die. We'll denote the number rolled during a turn as .
Jumps the chip  times. Recall that each field contains a value denoting the next field number to jump to.
After completing  turns, the game ends and he must calculate the respective probabilities for each field as to whether the game ended with the chip in that field.
Given , , , the game board, and the probabilities for each die face, print  lines where each line  contains the probability that the chip is on field  at the end of the game.

Note: All the probabilities in this task are rational numbers modulo . That is, if the probability can be expressed as the irreducible fraction  where , then it corresponds to the number  (or, alternatively, ). Click here to learn about Modular Multiplicative Inverse.

Input Format

The first line contains three space-separated integers describing the respective values of  (the number of positions),  (the number of die faces), and  (the number of turns).
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective values of each  (i.e., the index of the field that field  can transition to).
The third line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective values of each  (where ) describing the probabilities of the faces of the -sided die.

Output Format

Print  lines of output in which each line  contains a single integer,  (where ), denoting the probability that the chip will be on field  after  turns.
