Daniel loves graphs. He thinks a graph is special if it has the following properties:

It is undirected.
The length of each edge is .
It includes exactly  different lovely triplets.
A triplet is a set of  different nodes. A triplet is lovely if the minimum distance between each pair of nodes in the triplet is exactly . Two triplets are different if  or more of their component nodes are different.

Given  and , help Daniel draw a special graph.

Input Format

A single line containing  space-separated integers,  (the number of different lovely triplets you must have in your graph) and  (the required distance between each pair of nodes in a lovely triplet), respectively.

Constraints

Output Format

For the first line, print  space-separated integers,  (the number of nodes in the graph) and  (the number of edges in the graph), respectively.
On each line  of the  subsequent lines, print two space-separated integers,  and , describing an edge between nodes  and .

Your output must satisfy the following conditions:



If there is more than one correct answer, print any one of them.
