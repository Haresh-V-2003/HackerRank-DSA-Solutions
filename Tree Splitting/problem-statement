Given a tree with vertices numbered from  to . You need to process  queries. Each query represents a vertex number encoded in the following way:

Queries are encoded in the following way: Let,  be the  query and  be the answer for the  query where  and  is always . Then vertex . We are assure that  is between  and , and hasn't been removed before.

Note:  is the bitwise XOR operator.

For each query, first decode the vertex  and then perform the following:

Print the size of the connected component containing .
Remove vertex  and all edges connected to .
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of vertices in the tree.
Each line  of the  subsequent lines (where ) contains  space-separated integers describing the respective nodes,  and , connected by edge .
The next line contains a single integer, , denoting the number of queries.
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains a single integer, vertex number .

Constraints

Output Format

For each query, print the size of the corresponding connected component on a new line.
