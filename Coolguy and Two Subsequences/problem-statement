Coolguy gives you a simple problem. Given a -indexed array, , containing  elements, what will  be after this pseudocode is implemented and executed? Print .

//f(a, b) is a function that returns the minimum element in interval [a, b]

ans = 0

for a -> [1, n]
    for b -> [a, n]
        for c -> [b + 1, n]
            for d -> [c, n]
                ans = ans + min(f(a, b), f(c, d))
Input Format
